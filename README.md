# Stroke Risk Prediction Analysis
A machine learning project focused on predicting the likelihood of a stroke based on clinical and demographic data. Built using Python on Google Colab, this project applies various ML models to analyze risk factors and provide accurate stroke predictions. The goal is to assist in early identification and prevention planning for high-risk individuals.

## Problem Statement: ##
Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Early detection of stroke risk can significantly reduce its impact. This project uses supervised learning algorithms to predict whether a person is likely to suffer a stroke, based on a dataset of patient attributes.

## Key Features: ##
* Data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas and NumPy
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Matplotlib and Seaborn
* Feature selection and encoding techniques
* Trained multiple ML models including:
  * Logistic Regression
  * Random Forest
  * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
* Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance
* Final model deployment-ready with input-based prediction function

## Technologies & Tools Used: ##
* Language: Python
* Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Platform: Google Colab
* Dataset: Kaggle Stroke Prediction Dataset (or mention if custom)

## Outcomes: ##
* Achieved a high-performing model with ROC-AUC score > 0.85
* Gained insights into key risk factors like age, hypertension, and heart disease
* Useful as a base for developing real-world health tech solutions
